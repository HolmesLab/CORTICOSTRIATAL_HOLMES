Data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas can be downloaded at the following url:

http://human.brain-map.org/static/download

Data correspond to files available under 'Complete normalized microarray datasets' heading,
which were preprocessed using the AHBA's improved normalization process implemented in March 2013. 
AHBA data were downloaded by K.M.A. in summer of 2016. 

N.B. On the Allen Institute website, the donor numbers are the following "H0351.2001, H0351.2002, H0351.1009, H0351.1012, H0351.1015, H0351.1016."
        However, once downloaded and unzipped the donor numbers will correspond to those below.
